# VCR can update content length headers to solve various problems caused
# by recording and playing back requests and responses.  The update process
# happens in a before_playback hook.  Filtering senstive data also occurs
# in before hooks.  Since there isn't a way to make sure that the content
# length update happens after filtering senstive data (and since filtering
# data can mess with the content length), we end up not getting the benefit
# out of the update_content_length_header hook that we are shooting for.
# This monkey patch fixes this by forcing a content length update after
# every filtering of sensitive data.  This does more work than we need
# but it is also fast so it isn't that big of a deal.
