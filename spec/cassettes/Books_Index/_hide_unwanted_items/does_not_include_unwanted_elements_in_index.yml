        stars in a galaxy. Teachers could ask students how gravity affects life on
        Earth. Students will likely mention how gravity keeps us on Earth\u2019s surface.
        Prompt them, if necessary, to also think about Earth\u2019s orbital motion
        around the sun. This motion allows Earth to bask in the warmth of the sun\u2019s
        light. Without the Sun\u2019s gravity, Earth would continue moving in a straight
        line and move away from the sun, while people would float off of Earth\u2019s
        surface. The orbit of the moon could also be brought into this discussion,
        because Earth\u2019s gravity keeps the moon moving around Earth rather than
        continuing in a straight path.</p>\n</div></div><section data-depth=\"1\"
        id=\"fs-id1164354587065\"><h3 data-type=\"title\">What Physics Is</h3><p id=\"fs-id1164353488300\">Think
        about all of the technological devices that you use on a regular basis. Computers,
        wireless internet, smart phones, tablets, global positioning system (GPS),
        MP3 players, and satellite radio might come to mind. Next, think about the
        most exciting modern technologies that you have heard about in the news, such
        as trains that levitate above their tracks, <em data-effect=\"italics\">invisibility
        cloaks</em> that bend light around them, and microscopic robots that fight
        diseased cells in our bodies. All of these groundbreaking advancements rely
        on the principles of <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"term1\" group-by=\"p\">physics</span>.</p>\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1169316365038\">Physics is a branch of science. The word <em data-effect=\"italics\">science</em>
        comes from a Latin word that means <em data-effect=\"italics\">having knowledge</em>,
        and refers the knowledge of how the physical world operates, based on objective
        evidence determined through observation and experimentation. A key requirement
        of any scientific explanation of a natural phenomenon is that it must be testable;
        one must be able to devise and conduct an experimental investigation that
        either supports or refutes the explanation. It is important to note that some
        questions fall outside the realm of science precisely because they deal with
        phenomena that are not scientifically testable. This need for objective evidence
        helps define the investigative process scientists follow, which will be described
        later in this chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1164354537908\">Physics is the science
        aimed at describing the fundamental aspects of our universe. This includes
        what things are in it, what properties of those things are noticeable, and
        what processes those things or their properties undergo. In simpler terms,
        physics attempts to describe the basic mechanisms that make our universe behave
        the way it does. For example, consider a smart phone (<a href=\"#Figure_01_01_phone\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">Figure 1.2</a>). Physics describes how electric
        current interacts with the various circuits inside the device. This knowledge
        helps engineers select the appropriate materials and circuit layout when building
        the smart phone. Next, consider a GPS. Physics describes the relationship
        between the speed of an object, the distance over which it travels, and the
        time it takes to travel that distance. When you use a GPS device in a vehicle,
        it utilizes these physics relationships to determine the travel time from
        one location to another.</p>\n\n<div class=\"os-figure\"><figure id=\"Figure_01_01_phone\"><span

        our technology evolved over the centuries, physics expanded into many branches.
        Ancient peoples could only study things that they could see with the naked
        eye or otherwise experience without the aid of scientific equipment. This
        included the study of <span data-type=\"term\" class=\"no-emphasis\" id=\"term2\"
        group-by=\"k\">kinematics</span>, which is the study of moving objects. For
        example, ancient people often studied the apparent motion of objects in the
        sky, such as the sun, moon, and stars. This is evident in the construction
        of prehistoric astronomical observatories, such as Stonehenge in England (shown
        in <a href=\"#Figure_01_01_Stonehenge\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">Figure
        1.3</a>). </p>\n<div class=\"os-figure\"><figure id=\"Figure_01_01_Stonehenge\"><span

        id=\"fs-id1164354617452\">Ancient people also studied <span data-type=\"term\"
        class=\"no-emphasis\" id=\"term3\" group-by=\"s\">statics</span> and <span
        data-type=\"term\" class=\"no-emphasis\" id=\"term4\" group-by=\"d\">dynamics</span>,
        which focus on how objects start moving, stop moving, and change speed and
        direction in response to forces that push or pull on the objects. This early
        interest in kinematics and dynamics allowed humans to invent simple machines,
        such as the lever, the pulley, the ramp, and the wheel. These simple machines
        were gradually combined and integrated to produce more complicated machines,
        such as wagons and cranes. Machines allowed humans to gradually do more work
        more effectively in less time, allowing them to create larger and more complicated
        buildings and structures, many of which still exist today from ancient times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1164354554377\">As technology advanced, the branches of physics
        diversified even more. These include branches such as <span data-type=\"term\"
        class=\"no-emphasis\" id=\"term5\" group-by=\"a\">acoustics</span>, the study
        of sound, and <span data-type=\"term\" class=\"no-emphasis\" id=\"term6\"
        group-by=\"o\">optics</span>, the study of the light. In 1608, the invention
        of the telescope by a Germany spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey, led to huge
        breakthroughs in astronomy\u2014the study of objects or phenomena in space.
        One year later, in 1609, Galileo Galilei began the first studies of the solar
        system and the universe using a telescope. During the Renaissance era, Isaac
        Newton used observations made by Galileo to construct his three laws of motion.
        These laws were the standard for studying kinematics and dynamics even today.</p>\n\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1164354602999\">Another major branch of physics is <span data-type=\"term\"
        class=\"no-emphasis\" id=\"term7\" group-by=\"t\">thermodynamics</span>, which
        includes the study of thermal energy and the transfer of heat. James Prescott
        Joule, an English physicist, studied the nature of heat and its relationship
        to work. Joule\u2019s work helped lay the foundation for the first of three
        laws of thermodynamics that describe how energy in our universe is transferred
        from one object to another or transformed from one form to another. Studies
        in thermodynamics were motivated by the need to make engines more efficient,
        keep people safe from the elements, and preserve food.</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id1164354472610\">The

        create magnetic fields. In 1831, English inventor Michael Faraday showed that
        moving a wire through a magnetic field could induce an electric current. These
        studies led to the inventions of the electric motor and electric generator,

        of light, (2) the objects dealt with must be large enough to be seen with
        the naked eye, and (3) only weak gravity, such as that generated by Earth,
        can be involved. Very small objects, such as atoms and molecules, cannot be
        adequately explained by classical physics. These three conditions apply to

        during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, resulting in revolutionary changes in
        technology, society, and our view of the universe. As a result, many aspects
        of modern physics, which occur outside of the range of our everyday experience,
        may seem bizarre or unbelievable. So why is most of this textbook devoted
        to classical physics? There are two main reasons. The first is that knowledge
        of classical physics is necessary to understand modern physics. The second
        reason is that classical physics still gives an accurate description of the
        universe under a wide range of everyday circumstances.</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id1164353401992\">Modern
        physics includes two revolutionary theories: relativity and quantum mechanics.
        These theories deal with the very fast and the very small, respectively. The
        <span data-type=\"term\" id=\"term15\" group-by=\"t\">theory of relativity</span>
        was developed by Albert Einstein in 1905. By examining how two observers moving
        relative to each other would see the same phenomena, Einstein devised radical
        new ideas about time and space. He came to the startling conclusion that the
        measured length of an object travelling at high speeds (greater than about
        one percent of the speed of light) is shorter than the same object measured
        at rest. Perhaps even more bizarre is the idea the time for the same process
        to occur is different depending on the motion of the observer. Time passes
        more slowly for an object travelling at high speeds. A trip to the nearest
        star system, Alpha Centauri, might take an astronaut 4.5 Earth years if the
        ship travels near the speed of light. However, because time is slowed at higher
        speeds, the astronaut would age only 0.5 years during the trip. Einstein\u2019s
        ideas of relativity were accepted after they were confirmed by numerous experiments.</p>\n\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1164354538885\">Gravity, the force that holds us to Earth, can also
        affect time and space. For example, time passes more slowly on Earth\u2019s
        surface than for objects farther from the surface, such as a satellite in
        orbit. The very accurate clocks on global positioning satellites have to correct
        for this. They slowly keep getting ahead of clocks at Earth\u2019s surface.
        This is called time dilation, and it occurs because gravity, in essence, slows
        down time.</p>\n\n<div data-type=\"note\" id=\"fs-id1164354564070\" class=\"os-teacher\"><h3

        id=\"fs-id1164354949787\"><span>[AL]</span>By saying that time passes more
        slowly at near-light speeds or high gravity, it is important to mention that
        people in both locations perceive the second as the same length of time.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1164354495139\">Large objects, like Earth, have strong enough gravity
        to distort space. To visualize this idea, think about a bowling ball placed
        on a trampoline. The bowling ball depresses or curves the surface of the trampoline.
        If you rolled a marble across the trampoline, it would follow the surface
        of the trampoline, roll into the depression caused by the bowling ball, and
        hit the ball. Similarly, the Earth curves space around it in the shape of
        a funnel. These curves in space due to the Earth cause objects to be attracted
        to Earth (i.e., gravity).</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id1164354634189\">Because of the
        way gravity affects space and time, Einstein stated that gravity affects the
        space-time continuum, as illustrated in <a href=\"#Figure_01_01_Earth\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">Figure
        1.4</a>. This is why time proceeds more slowly at Earth\u2019s surface than
        in orbit. In black holes, whose gravity is hundreds of times that of Earth,
        time passes so slowly that it would appear to a far-away observer to have
        stopped!</p>\n\n<div class=\"os-figure\"><figure id=\"Figure_01_01_Earth\"><span

        id=\"fs-id1164354569346\">In summary, relativity says that in describing the
        universe, it is important to realize that time, space and speed are not absolute.
        Instead, they can appear different to different observers. Einstein\u2019s
        ability to reason out relativity is even more amazing because we cannot see
        the effects of relativity in our everyday lives.</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id1164354678126\">Quantum
        mechanics is the second major theory of modern physics. Quantum mechanics
        deals with the very small, namely, the subatomic particles that make up atoms.
        Atoms (<a href=\"#Figure_01_01_gold\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">Figure
        1.5</a>) are the smallest units of elements. However, atoms themselves are
        constructed of even smaller subatomic particles, such as protons, neutrons
        and electrons. Quantum mechanics strives to describe the properties and behavior
        of these and other subatomic particles. Often, these particles do not behave
        in the ways expected by classical physics. One reason for this is that they
        are small enough to travel at great speeds, near the speed of light.</p><div

        id=\"fs-id1164354555075\">On November 12, 2014, the European Space Agency\u2019s
        Rosetta spacecraft (shown in <a href=\"#Figure_01_01_Rosetta\" class=\"autogenerated-content\">Figure
        1.10</a>) became the first ever to reach and orbit a comet. Shortly after,
        Rosetta\u2019s rover, Philae, landed on the comet, representing the first
        time humans have ever landed a space probe on a comet.</p><div class=\"os-figure\"><figure

        id=\"fs-id1164354468641\">After traveling 6.4 billion kilometers starting
        from its launch on Earth, Rosetta landed on the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko,
        which is only 4 kilometers wide. Physics was needed to successfully plot the
        course to reach such a small, distant, and rapidly moving target. Rosetta\u2019s
        path to the comet was not straight forward. The probe first had to travel
        to Mars so that Mars\u2019s gravity could accelerate it and divert it in the
        exact direction of the comet. </p><p id=\"fs-id1164354594416\">This was not
        the first time humans used gravity to power our spaceships. Voyager 2, a space
        probe launched in 1977, used the gravity of Saturn to <em data-effect=\"italics\">slingshot</em>
        over to Uranus and Neptune (illustrated in <a href=\"#Figure_01_01_solar\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">Figure 1.11</a>), providing the first pictures
        ever taken of these planets. Now, almost 40 years after its launch, Voyager
        2 is at the very edge of our solar system and is about to enter interstellar
        space. Its sister ship, Voyager 1 (illustrated in <a href=\"#Figure_01_01_solar\"
        class=\"autogenerated-content\">Figure 1.11</a>), which was also launched
        in 1977, is already there.</p><p id=\"fs-id1164354871882\">To listen to the

        id=\"fs-id1164354626383\">Both Voyagers have electrical power generators based
        on the decay of radioisotopes. These generators have served them for almost
        40 years. Rosetta, on the other hand, is solar-powered. In fact, Rosetta became
        the first space probe to travel beyond the asteroid belt by relying only on
        solar cells for power generation.</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id1164353487283\">At 800
        million kilometers from the sun, Rosetta receives sunlight that is only 4
        percent as strong as on Earth. In addition, it is very cold in space. Therefore,
        a lot of physics went into developing Rosetta\u2019s low-intensity low-temperature
        solar cells.</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id1164354501460\">In this sense, the Rosetta
        project nicely shows the huge range of topics encompassed by physics: from
        modeling the movement of gigantic planets over huge distances within our solar
        systems, to learning how to generate electric power from low-intensity light.
        Physics is, by far, the broadest field of science.</p>\n\n<div data-type=\"exercise\"

        across the solar system using gravitational sling shots. In addition, the
        physics behind the power systems of these probes is compared. This is meant
        to reinforce how physics applies over wide ranges, from the immense distances
        in our universe to the tiny sizes of subatomic particles.</p>\n<p id=\"fs-id1164353500231\">Answers
        to the Grasp Check may vary. A sample answer: You would have to how the target
        planet moves to know when to launch the probe so it actually reaches the planet.
        You would also need to know and account for the effects of gravity from other
        planets during the path followed during its journey.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1164354633460\">In summary, physics studies many of the most basic
        aspects of science. A knowledge of physics is, therefore, necessary to understand
        all other sciences. This is because physics explains the most basic ways in
        which our universe works. However, it is not necessary to formally study all
        applications of physics. A knowledge of the basic laws of physics will be
        most useful to you, so that you can use them to solve some everyday problems.
        In this way, the study of physics can improve your problem-solving skills.</p>\n</section>\n\n\n\n<section

        which it travels, and the time it takes to travel that distance. When you

        physics includes two revolutionary theories: relativity and quantum mechanics.
        These theories deal with the very fast and the very small, respectively. The
        theory of relativity was developed by Albert Einstein in 1905. By examining
        how two observers moving relative to each other would see the same phenomena,
        Einstein devised radical new ideas about time and space. He came to the startling
        conclusion that the measured length of an object travelling at high speeds
        (greater than about one percent of the speed of light) is shorter than the
        same object measured at rest. Perhaps even more bizarre is the idea the time
        for the same process to occur is different depending on the motion of the
        observer. Time passes more slowly for an object travelling at high speeds.
        A trip to the nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, might take an astronaut
        4.5 Earth years if the ship travels near the speed of light. However, because
        time is slowed at higher speeds, the astronaut would age only 0.5 years during
        the trip. Einsteinâ€™s ideas of relativity were accepted after they were confirmed
        by numerous experiments.","hidden_content":null}'
