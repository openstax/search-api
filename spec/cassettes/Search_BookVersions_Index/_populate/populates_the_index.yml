        <span data-type=\"term\" group-by=\"a\" id=\"term1\">anatomy</span> is the
        scientific study of the body\u2019s structures. Some of these structures are
        very small and can only be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a
        microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen, manipulated, measured,
        and weighed. The word \u201canatomy\u201d comes from a Greek root that means
        \u201cto cut apart.\u201d Human anatomy was first studied by observing the
        exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and other injuries.
        Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment their
        knowledge. When a body is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order
        to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to one another.
        Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology
        labs. In order to observe structures in living people, however, a number of
        imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques allow clinicians
        to visualize structures inside the living body such as a cancerous tumor or
        a fractured bone.</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id2608267\">Like most scientific disciplines,
        anatomy has areas of specialization. <span data-type=\"term\" group-by=\"G\"
        id=\"term2\">Gross anatomy</span> is the study of the larger structures of
        the body, those visible without the aid of magnification (<a class=\"autogenerated-content\"
        href=\"#fig-ch01_01_01\">Figure 1.2</a><strong data-effect=\"bold\">a</strong>).
        Macro- means \u201clarge,\u201d thus, gross anatomy is also referred to as
        macroscopic anatomy. In contrast, micro- means \u201csmall,\u201d and <span
        data-type=\"term\" group-by=\"m\" id=\"term3\">microscopic anatomy</span>
        is the study of structures that can be observed only with the use of a microscope
        or other magnification devices (<a class=\"autogenerated-content\" href=\"#fig-ch01_01_01\">Figure
        1.2</a><strong data-effect=\"bold\">b</strong>). Microscopic anatomy includes
        cytology, the study of cells and histology, the study of tissues. As the technology
        of microscopes has advanced, anatomists have been able to observe smaller
        and smaller structures of the body, from slices of large structures like the
        heart, to the three-dimensional structures of large molecules in the body.</p><div

        take two general approaches to the study of the body\u2019s structures: regional
        and systemic. <span data-type=\"term\" group-by=\"R\" id=\"term4\">Regional
        anatomy</span> is the study of the interrelationships of all of the structures
        in a specific body region, such as the abdomen. Studying regional anatomy
        helps us appreciate the interrelationships of body structures, such as how
        muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and other structures work together to serve
        a particular body region. In contrast, <span data-type=\"term\" group-by=\"s\"
        id=\"term5\">systemic anatomy</span> is the study of the structures that make
        up a discrete body system\u2014that is, a group of structures that work together
        to perform a unique body function. For example, a systemic anatomical study
        of the muscular system would consider all of the skeletal muscles of the body.</p>\n\n<p
        id=\"fs-id1707081\">Whereas anatomy is about structure, physiology is about
        function. Human <span data-type=\"term\" group-by=\"p\" id=\"term6\">physiology</span>
        is the scientific study of the chemistry and physics of the structures of
        the body and the ways in which they work together to support the functions
        of life. Much of the study of physiology centers on the body\u2019s tendency
        toward homeostasis. <span data-type=\"term\" group-by=\"H\" id=\"term7\">Homeostasis</span>
        is the state of steady internal conditions maintained by living things. The
        study of physiology certainly includes observation, both with the naked eye
        and with microscopes, as well as manipulations and measurements. However,
        current advances in physiology usually depend on carefully designed laboratory
        experiments that reveal the functions of the many structures and chemical
        compounds that make up the human body.</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id2297149\">Like
        anatomists, physiologists typically specialize in a particular branch of physiology.
        For example, neurophysiology is the study of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves
        and how these work together to perform functions as complex and diverse as
        vision, movement, and thinking. Physiologists may work from the organ level
        (exploring, for example, what different parts of the brain do) to the molecular
        level (such as exploring how an electrochemical signal travels along nerves).</p>\n\n<p
        id=\"fs-id2104406\">Form is closely related to function in all living things.
        For example, the thin flap of your eyelid can snap down to clear away dust
        particles and almost instantaneously slide back up to allow you to see again.
        At the microscopic level, the arrangement and function of the nerves and muscles
        that serve the eyelid allow for its quick action and retreat. At a smaller
        level of analysis, the function of these nerves and muscles likewise relies
        on the interactions of specific molecules and ions. Even the three-dimensional
        structure of certain molecules is essential to their function.</p>\n\n<p id=\"fs-id2080383\">Your
        study of anatomy and physiology will make more sense if you continually relate
        the form of the structures you are studying to their function. In fact, it
        can be somewhat frustrating to attempt to study anatomy without an understanding
        of the physiology that a body structure supports. Imagine, for example, trying
        to appreciate the unique arrangement of the bones of the human hand if you
        had no conception of the function of the hand. Fortunately, your understanding
        of how the human hand manipulates tools\u2014from pens to cell phones\u2014helps
        you appreciate the unique alignment of the thumb in opposition to the four
        fingers, making your hand a structure that allows you to pinch and grasp objects
        and type text messages.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  </div></body>\n</html>\n",
